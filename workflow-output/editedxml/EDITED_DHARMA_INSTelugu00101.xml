The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> in question indeed looks like ⟨jlu⟩. As far as I can say from my bad scan the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> that was read as ⟨va⟩ by Prabhākara Śāstri could also be ⟨ma⟩. The following <foreign>akṣara</foreign> could be ⟨lla⟩ as spelled in the Zulakallu plates of Vijayāditya I (line 17) (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Gai1965-1966_01"/></bibl>), i. e. with the right upward line of the superscript ⟨l⟩ drawn downwards on the left side ending into subscript ⟨l⟩. The single ⟨la⟩ is written in its fuller form in line 4 of our Telugu inscription but also occurs in a slightly more advanced form in line 14.</note>

                       <note>According to Prabhākaraśāstri the spelling should be ⟨pa⟩ (note no. 6); the respective verb would be <foreign>paḍayu</foreign>. The line that Prabhākaraśāstri read as the vowel sign ⟨°e⟩ starts on the left side from the middle of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨pa⟩.

                       However, what is to be expected and what is written according to the picture of the estampage is <foreign>vanṟ agu</foreign> “he will be”.

The next śloka is incomplete as well. This time because the last two <foreign>pādas</foreign> are missing. From the picture as published in the edition it is not possible to say whether there was more room on top of the stone for the effaced rest of the śloka (because the inscription is written from the bottom to the top), or whether the stone is broken on top. Regarding the overall bad writing of the Sanskrit lines it is also possible that the scribe wanted to write only one single śloka but mixed up two <foreign>pādas</foreign> of different ślokas each. The way these two parts a put together does not form a coherent thought and hence must have been a mistake.</note>

                       <note>Prabhākaraśāstri reads <foreign>taśyaśya</foreign>. The scan of Prabhākaraśāstri’s article at my disposal is of a bad quality. On the picture I can see a shade of what could be interpreted as a ⟨śa⟩ but I can not see traces of subscript ⟨ya⟩. However, Prabhākaraśāstri may be right that the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨śa⟩ was written twice by mistake.</note>

                       <note>There is still space in this line but no <foreign>akṣara</foreign> seems to be written there. Hence, the scribe must have deemed his work finished. Prabhākaraśāstri read the first <foreign>akṣara</foreign> of this line as ⟨pa⟩ but in my opinion it more resembles ⟨ṣa⟩. I think that this ⟨ṣa⟩ is the first <foreign>akṣara</foreign> of the third <foreign>pāda</foreign> of the respective <foreign>śloka</foreign> the first two <foreign>pādas</foreign> of which have been encarved on the stone. This corroborates my idea that the scribe mixed up two different <foreign>ślokas</foreign> and made the best out of it.</note>

               My own reading is based on the picture in Prabhākara Śāstri’s edition. I only had acces to a bad scan. That is why my reading might be faulty in one or other place.
