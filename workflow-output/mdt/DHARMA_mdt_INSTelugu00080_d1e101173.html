                Remarks: </span>The date interval represents the rule of Eastern Cāḷukya Guṇaga-Vijayāditya III because he is said to have defeated a certain Saṁkila in battle. The latter is mentioned together with rulers of the Gaṅga and the Nōḻamba who are said to have also been defeated. Under the premise that Saṁkila is the same as Saṅkali of the Telugu inscription he must have ruled in the time of Vijayāditya III. The inscription was published without a picture.
