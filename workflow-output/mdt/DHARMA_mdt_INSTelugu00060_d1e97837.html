                Remarks: </span>The editors in EI surmise that the inscription was issued around 750 CE, the name of the ruler being formed after Vijayāditya of the Calukyas. However, the lines that mention the name are now lost and only retrievable from the Mackenzie collection's eye-copy. The name is written there as 'vijayādi'. The akṣara &lt;yā&gt;, however, looks almost like &lt;mā&gt; so that in case of a misreading of &lt;ja&gt; the actual name may have been Vikramāditya. If so, the 22nd year of his reign would have been 697 CE. The date interval covers both approaches. Regnal year: Vijayāditya-Cōḻamahārāja, year 22</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="font-weight-bold">
