The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> in question indeed looks like ⟨jlu⟩. As far as I can say from my bad scan the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> that was read as ⟨va⟩ by Prabhākara Śāstri could also be ⟨ma⟩. The following <foreign>akṣara</foreign> could be ⟨lla⟩ as spelled in the Zulakallu plates of Vijayāditya I (line 17) (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Gai1965-1966_01"/></bibl>), i. e. with the right upward line of the superscript ⟨l⟩ drawn downwards on the left side ending into subscript ⟨l⟩. The single ⟨la⟩ is written in its fuller form in line 4 of our Telugu inscription but also occurs in a slightly more advanced form in line 14.</note>

The line that Prabhākaraśāstri read as the vowel sign ⟨°e⟩ starts on the left side from the middle of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨pa⟩.

                       <note>The akṣara ⟨I⟩ looks like ⟨I⟩ in line 4. The intended meaning, however, must be "this" (<foreign>ī</foreign>). Prabhākaraśāstri had a the original and the original estampage at his disposal wherefore his reading may be correct. However, I cannot see any vowel sign on ⟨ṇḍ⟩ and it seems that the vowel simply was forgotten. On the other hand, the lower part of ⟨ṭi⟩ seems to be damaged on the scan available to me so that it is also possible that the vowel sign of ⟨ṇḍ⟩ may have been lost due to damage. I supplied a long ⟨°ū⟩ due to the reading <foreign>reṇḍūṭṭi</foreign>- in line 11.</note>

                       <note>According to Prabhākaraśāstri (note no. 11) the reading is unclear and also <foreign>canvaṁ</foreign> and <foreign>candhaṁ</foreign> are possible according to him (his alternative readings are very blurred in the bad scan at my disposal).The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨va⟩ is written in a little bit more elongated form than in e. g. line 14. The scribe forgot to write the horizontal line inside the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ṟa⟩ so that it is an empty oval and thus resembles a ⟨dha⟩ or ⟨va⟩. The reading <foreign>vanṟ agu</foreign> is what to be expected as can be seen from other inscriptions.</note>

The Telugu imprecation ends in its typical way so that no information is lacking that could have been given in line 18.</note>

The next <foreign>śloka</foreign> is incomplete as well. This time because the last two <foreign>pādas</foreign> are missing. From the picture as published in the edition it is not possible to say whether there was more room on top of the stone for the effaced rest of the <foreign>śloka</foreign> (because the inscription is written from the bottom to the top), or whether the stone is broken on top. Regarding the overall bad writing of the Sanskrit lines it is also possible that the scribe wanted to write only one single <foreign>śloka</foreign> but mixed up two <foreign>pādas</foreign> of different <foreign>ślokas</foreign> each. The way these two parts are put together does not form a coherent thought and hence must have been a mistake.</note>

                       <note>There is still space in this line but no <foreign>akṣara</foreign> seems to be written there. Hence, the scribe must have deemed his work finished.
