                                The inscription contains halantas. However, they are not always discernible purely based on their shape which might be due to the quality of the published picture. Halanta N is written slightly smaller (apart from akuN where the N is very small) and lacks the horizontal line on top of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign>. Halanta M is still rudimentarily visible on the picture but can not be clearly delineated from ⟨ma⟩ in line 1 and 4. The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ḻa⟩ is written in the standard form in line 3 (i. e. resembling a softly drawn w with inwardly curled edges) but is written with the curled edges drawn right into the middle so that they meet (like in the process of cellular meiosis) in line 1.

                 The inscription was published twice by Sōmaśēkhara Śarma whose second edition I could not obtain. The text as published by Radha Krishna, however, may reflect this second edition that seems to basically only differ in the correct representation of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ḻ⟩ as opposed to the edition in Vyāsasaṁgrahamu. The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ḻ⟩ is clearly written in the inscription. Sōmaśēkhara Śarma refers to Tamil when dealing with this <foreign>akṣara</foreign> and hence the latter spelling must have been chosen due to the lack of a proper printing option at the time.
                 The reading as presented here is my own based on the picture in Vyāsasaṁgrahamu. The deviating readings as published by Radha Krishna have been assigned to himself although they may reflect the readings in Sōmaśēkhara Śarma's second edition.
                 Lines 1-4 are written on the broader and polished side of the "red stone" (యెర్రరాయి) and line 5 on the side of the stone (<bibl><ptr target="bib:SomasekharaSarma1933_01"/><citedRange unit="page">301, 304</citedRange></bibl>).
                 Sōmaśēkhara Śarma interpreted <foreign>Aṇapotulu</foreign> (with short o) to be a Prakrit form of <foreign>ājñāpati</foreign> (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:SomasekharaSarma1933_01"/><citedRange unit="page">308-309</citedRange></bibl>). He read <foreign>oḷana</foreign> (instead of <foreign>ēḷaN</foreign>) which he phrased as "in subordination to" (అధీనతయందలి) or "in the authority of" (అధికారమునందలి) (the ruler) (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:SomasekharaSarma1933_01"/><citedRange unit="page">308</citedRange></bibl>). In this case the donation would have been made by the ruler and the two other persons could have been <foreign>ājñapti</foreign>s although the syntax would be a little bit odd. However, as it seems to me the inscription provides the usual formula <hi rend="italic">XYZ ēḷaN</hi> which only refers to the reign of a ruler so that the agents (donors) are the three other persons. The name <foreign>Aṇapōtulu</foreign> is a honorific plural and seems to consist of <foreign>aṇa</foreign> 'elder brother' (normally used as second element in names) and <foreign>pōtu</foreign> 'male'.

                 Another inscription that mentions the rule of Cōḻa-Mahārāja and the scribe Asivairuvu is DHARMA_INSTelugu00015.
